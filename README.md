# FlashCards Starter Kit

The Flash Cards project is a solo project for Front End Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. The idea behind the project was to build a game that runs solely in the terminal that tests the users knowledge of coding terminology. The main goals of this project were to structure code progression based around Test Driven Design, implement a class based structure, and have functions and methods utilize a Singular Responsibility Principal.
